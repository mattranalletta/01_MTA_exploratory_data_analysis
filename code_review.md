## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- I appreciated the use of separate data cleaning & analysis notebooks

## Good Documentation:

- Great README.md with links to each file and explanations of the same
- Nice use of markdown cells throughout for section headings and explanations of decisions made / insights found
- Inline code comments were used sparingly, and only included when helpful and necessary

## Proper Data Science:

- Code demonstrates good command of python and pandas
- Good work exploring lines and separating out duplicate stations by lines served
- Effective way of finding actual entries/exits via implementation of transform(pd.Series.diff).abs()
- Good handling of error values, clear explanation
- Love the linear regression hypothesis and use of P-value
- Excellent visualizations, love the use of jointplots, heatmaps (very effective application) and folium! Horizontal bar charts was also a nice choice for readability & interpretability

## Comments:

- Great work on project 1! :)
- You made it super easy to follow your analysis
- Be sure to include axis labels & values on all graphs otherwise they're hard to interpret & not very meaningful (only the first couple were missing)
